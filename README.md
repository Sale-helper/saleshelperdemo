# salehelperdemo

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vite.dev/config/).

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

### Run Unit Tests with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)

```sh
npm run test:unit
```

### Run End-to-End Tests with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)

```sh
npm run test:e2e:dev
```

This runs the end-to-end tests against the Vite development server.
It is much faster than the production build.

But it's still recommended to test the production build with `test:e2e` before deploying (e.g. in CI environments):

```sh
npm run build
npm run test:e2e
```

## Deployment to GitHub Pages

This project is configured for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages.

### Automatic Deployment (Recommended)

1. **Enable GitHub Pages** in your repository settings:
   - Go to Settings â†’ Pages
   - Set Source to "GitHub Actions"

2. **Push to main branch**: The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically build and deploy your app.

### Manual Deployment

If you prefer manual deployment:

```sh
npm run deploy
```

This will build your project and deploy it to the `gh-pages` branch.

### Important Notes

- The app is configured to work with the repository name `saleshelperdemo` in the URL
- If you change the repository name, update the `base` property in `vite.config.js`
- The router uses hash mode for better GitHub Pages compatibility
